# AgentSim
Simple message passing framework simulating the behavior of stateful agents in a space.
Agents re-calculate their state based on the current state and the messages they receive.

This is a project I started for fun to experiment with data structures and software engineering in Haskell. 

The application can be built using the tool Stack.
